# Nada Maps
This website pulls fishing information from the [New York Open Data](https://data.ny.gov/) website and plots it to Google Maps to provide a comprehensive list of locations including detailed information about types of fish and regulations at each spot.
It also pulls images from Flickr to give a visual for the locations. It was created for fisherman in the state looking for new locations.

It uses some serverside PHP, so to run it you will need a working PHP server setup. 
However, most of the processing is done on the clientside, so it's not very server heavy.
